### Welcome to your first steps in hkube world we believe that you already familiar with kubernetes and docker.



# So you probably asking What is **HKUBE** ? 


**Hkube** is an open source, language agnostic framework to run distributed pipeline of algorithms that is built on Kubernetes. 
Hkube allows to run pipelines of algorithms on kubernetes cluster optimally utilizing the available resources, based on user priorities and other automatic heuristics. 

The pipeline is described with a simple Json that defines the flow of computation between algorithm building blocks.
