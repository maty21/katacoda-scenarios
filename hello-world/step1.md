lets start by installing hkube on kubernetes 

### wait for prerequisite installation 
1. node.js - needed for hkube installation
2. git clone 

### test prerequisite are ok 
1. run `kubectl get nodes`{{execute}} - verify the node is on ready state
2. run `node --version`{{execute}} - version should be 0.10.x

now we ready to start the journey :)

This is an _example_ of creating a scenario and running a **command**

`echo 'Hello World'`{{execute}}
